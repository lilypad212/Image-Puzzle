    <h1>Image Puzzle Write-Up</h1>
    <p>I took inspiration from the <a href=http://devjoe.appspot.com/huntindex/puzzle/mit20126a02>Cookin'</a>.
       puzzle. I didn’t want to make a video like they did because it would've been too complicated.
       The first time I saw the puzzle I didn’t understand at all what I was supposed to get out of
       the video; it wasn’t intuitive. The only part that I kept from the puzzle
       was the idea of somehow getting a number out of each cooking clip and
       using that number to index into the dish that was being cooked. And the
       letters you would get out of each clip then spelled a phrase/word. But
       instead of using video clips, I used images since they were the
       most easily accessible to me.</p>
      <p>In the first version I made, I had each picture in the same order as the
       letters they represented would be in the final answer; however, I then changed
       it so that each picture had a corresponding number. This gave me more
       freedom because I could put the pictures in random order and then have
       the user unscramble them at the end with the help of the blanks.</p>
